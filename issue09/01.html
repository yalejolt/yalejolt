						<p>Dear Readers,</p>

						<p>Translation has always had its skeptics. Take Robert Frost, who supposedly said, in a famous quip, that “poetry is what gets lost in translation.” But in a good translation, what gets lost is arguably outweighed by what’s preserved and <i>gained</i>: therein lies the poetry of translation. The pieces that follow are poems in their own right, even as they’ve been translated from a wide variety of languages.</p>

						<p>The design for this issue, which portrays translations and originals as two sides of a tapestry, challenges another skeptic of translation: the character of Don Quixote. In part two of Cervantes’ many-layered novel, the delusional would-be knight errant meets a translator in a printing house and goes on to pontificate about translation:</p>

						<p class="excerpt">It seems to me that translation from one language into another if it be not from the queens of languages, the Greek and the Latin, is like looking at Flemish tapestries on the wrong side; for though the figures are visible, they are full of threads that make them indistinct, and they do not show with the smoothness and brightness of the right side... (trans. Tobias Smollett)</p>

						<p>It is ironic that Don Quixote compares translations from vernacular languages—necessarily bad translations in his eyes—to the backs of Flemish tapestries. According to the Met’s website, Flemish tapestries were extremely well-made, so finely woven that there likely wouldn’t have been loose threads on the reverse side. Don Quixote chooses a clumsy metaphor that actually undermines his case: If translations are like the backs of Flemish tapestries, then they are, in fact, just as smooth and bright as the originals. In characteristically slant fashion, Cervantes warns us of reading at face value and makes us question whether we should really believe what Don Quixote says about translation.</p>

						<p>As it happens, about twenty years ago, the Met Cloisters began cleaning and restoring a set of Flemish tapestries known as “The Hunt of the Unicorn.” After removing the backings, which provide protection and support for these works of the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, the conservators were overcome with awe at what they&nbsp;found:</p>

						<p class="excerpt">The backs were almost perfect mirror images of the fronts, but the colors were different. Compared with the fronts, they were unfaded: incredibly bright, rich, and deep, more subtle and natural-looking. (<i>The New Yorker</i>,&nbsp;2005)</p>

						<p>Far from being “full of threads” that blurred the figures, the backs of these tapestries turned out to be like good translations—clean and vivid. In fact, the reverse sides, like good translations in a sense, were even brighter than the fronts. So it is that an artful translation reinvigorates the work in a new language and form, in a new time and&nbsp;place. </p>

						<p>The cover and back of this issue feature the two sides of “The Unicorn in Captivity,” one of the seven Flemish unicorn tapestries. The subject of these tapestries is also wonderfully relevant to translation, for what else does a translator strive to capture if not a unicorn—a mystical, magical creature of perfection?</p>

						<p>Yours, <br> Alice Yang</p>
