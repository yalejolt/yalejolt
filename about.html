						<h1>About JoLT</h1>
					</div>

					<div class="essay-text">
						<p>Hello! The <i>Journal of Literary Translation</i> (JoLT) publishes English translations of poetry and prose, as well as essays on the theory and practice of translation. A bi-annual magazine, JoLT seeks to showcase the excellent work of translators at Yale, to think critically about translation in a variety of contexts, and to explore metaphors for translation through the physical design of each issue. We strive to represent a diversity of languages and time periods, and accept both first translations and retranslations.</p>

						<p>To submit, please send your essay and/or translation, along with a copy of the original text, to <a href="mailto:submissions.jolt@gmail.com">submissions.jolt@gmail.com</a>. Up to six poems may be submitted at a time. Prose submissions, including essays, should not exceed ten pages double-spaced.</p>
